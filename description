#Pacman moving on in a grid, of dimensions 5 units x 5 units.
#(5,5)
#Pacman moving off the grid must be prevented, however further valid movement commands must still be allowed.

# PLACE will put the Pacman on the grid in positon X,Y and facing NORTH,SOUTH, EAST or WEST.
# The origin (0,0) can be considered the SOUTH WEST most corner.
# The first valid command to Pacman is a PLACE command, after that, any sequence of commands may be issued, in any order, including another PLACE command. The application should discard all commands in the sequence until a valid PLACE command has been executed.
# MOVE will move Pacman one unit forward in the direction it is currently facing.

# LEFT and RIGHT will rotate Pacman 90 degrees in the specified direction without changing the position of Pacman.
# REPORT will announce the X,Y and F of Pacman. This can be in any form, but standard output is sufficient.
# Pacman that is not on the grid can choose the ignore the MOVE, LEFT, RIGHT and REPORT commands.
# Input can be from a file, or from standard input, as the developer chooses.
# Provide test data to exercise the application.
